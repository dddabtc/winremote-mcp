# WinRemote MCP — Windows Remote Control via MCP

**The ultimate Windows MCP server for remote desktop control and automation.**

Control any Windows machine through the Model Context Protocol — perfect for AI agents, Claude Desktop, and OpenClaw integration. Transform your Windows desktop into a powerful, remotely-accessible automation endpoint.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install from PyPI
pip install winremote-mcp

# Start the Windows MCP server
winremote-mcp
```

Your Windows MCP server is now running on `http://127.0.0.1:8090` and ready to accept commands from MCP clients.
